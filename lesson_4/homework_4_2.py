# FUNCTIONS

# Difference
# Write a function, which will calculate the difference of these two numbers

def difference(num_1, num_2):
    return num_1 - num_2


# Division
# Write a function, which will divide these two numbers

def division(num_1, num_2):
    return num_1 / num_2


# Function gets random number. If this number is more than ten, return the difference between 100 and this number,
# otherwise return this number multiplied by 10

def function_1(number):
    if number > 10:
        print(100 - number)
    else:
        print (number * 10)


# Your function temerature_convertor gets the temperature in Fahrenheit, convert it to Celsius and return.
# Formula (32°F − 32) × 5/9 = 0°C

def temerature_convertor(fahrenheit_degree):
    print((fahrenheit_degree - 32) * 5 / 9)


# Taxi Fare
# In a particular jurisdiction, taxi fares consist of a base fare of $4.00, plus $0.25 for every 140 meters travelled.
# Write a function that takes the distance travelled (in kilometers) as its only parameter and returns the total fare
# as its only result rounded by 2 digits. Write a program that demonstrates the function.

def taxi_fare(distance):
    print(round(distance * 1000 / 140 * 0.25 + 4, 2))

# examples of usage:
# taxi_fare(10) #21.86
